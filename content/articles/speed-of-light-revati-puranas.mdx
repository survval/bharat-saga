# Speed of Light, Time & the Revati Story in Puranic Lore

Modern physics says:  
> **Nothing travels faster than light** (as far as we know).

- Speed of light ≈ **186,000 miles/second** (≈ 3,00,000 km/s)
- 1 **light-year** = distance light travels in **one year**

In some traditional commentaries on Vedic verses and in later works, we find:

1. A **numerical estimate** of light speed using units like *yojana* and *nimisha*  
2. A **Puranic story** about King Raivata and his daughter Revati visiting Brahma-loka, where **time runs differently** — very similar to the modern idea of **time dilation**.

This article explains both in simple language.

## 1. Ancient Calculation of Light Speed

A famous traditional verse (quoted by later scholars) says, in essence:

> **In half a *nimisha*, light travels 2,202 *yojanas*.**

To unpack this, we need to understand two old units:

- **Yojana** – a unit of distance  
- **Nimisha** – a unit of time

### 1.1. Time Unit: Nimisha

Ancient Hindu time division:

- 15 **nimishas** = 1 **kashtha**  
- 30 **kashthas** = 1 **kala**  
- 30 **kalas** = 1 **muhurta**  
- 30 **muhurta** = 1 **day**

So:

> **1 day = 15 × 30 × 30 × 30 = 405,000 nimishas**

Modern day:

- 1 day = 24 hours  
- = 24 × 60 × 60  
- = **86,400 seconds**

So we can relate them:

- 405,000 nimishas = 86,400 seconds  
- 1 nimisha = 86,400 / 405,000 seconds  
- ≈ **16/75 seconds** ≈ **0.213 s**  
- ½ nimisha = **8/75 seconds** ≈ **0.106 s**

### 1.2. Distance Unit: Yojana

There are slightly different traditional values; a common one used is:

> **1 yojana ≈ 9 miles**

The verse says:

> In **half a nimisha (½ nimisha)**, light travels **2,202 yojanas**.

So in **8/75 seconds**:

- Distance = 2,202 × 9 miles  
- ≈ **19,818 miles**

Speed ≈ distance / time:

- 19,818 miles ÷ (8/75 seconds)  
- = 19,818 × 75 / 8  
- ≈ **185,000–187,500 miles/second** (depending on rounding)

This is **astonishingly close** to the modern value:

- Modern physics: **186,000 miles/s**  
- Traditional calculation: ≈ **187,500 miles/s**

### 1.3. Quick Comparison

| Source                         | Value (approx.)             |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Traditional computation** | ~**187,500 mi/s** |
| **Modern measurement (physics)** | **186,282 mi/s** |

📌 **Important Note**  
We cannot *prove* that ancient scholars had laboratory-style measurements like modern physics. However, the **scale and closeness of the number** show they were thinking in very large distances and high speeds.

## 2. What is a Light-Year? (Simple)

Because space is so huge, scientists use **light-years**:
- 1 light-year = distance light travels in 1 year  
- Roughly ≈ 6 trillion miles (≈ 9.46 trillion km)

Example: A star **4.3 light-years** away (like Alpha Centauri). The light we see **today** left that star **4.3 years ago**. So when we look into the night sky, in a way, **we are looking into the past.**

## 3. Time Dilation: What Happens Near Light Speed?

Modern relativity says:
- When you travel close to **light speed**, your **time slows down** compared to people at rest.
- Your **aging process slows** and your **clock ticks slower**.
- You might travel for what feels like **a short time** to you, but centuries may have passed on Earth.

This effect is conceptually very close to **relativistic time slowing down**, where time almost stands still for the traveler.

## 4. The Revati Story: Time Runs Faster on Earth

Now let’s connect to the **Puranic story** about **King Raivata (Kakudmi)** and his daughter **Revati**.

### 4.1. The Problem: Finding a Perfect Groom

King Raivata searched the entire Earth for a suitable husband for his highly virtuous daughter Revati, but felt no one was worthy enough. So he decided to **ask Brahma himself** for guidance.

---

### 4.2. Journey to Brahma-loka

Raivata traveled to **Brahma-loka** beyond Earth and earthly time. There, Brahma was listening to a celestial music performance. Raivata respectfully waited until the music ended to ask his question.

---

### 4.3. Brahma’s Shocking Answer: Time Difference

Brahma smiled and explained that time flows differently in his realm. While Raivata waited for a short while, **many ages (Yugas) had passed on Earth**. Dynasties had changed, and the world he left behind no longer existed.

Brahma advised him that in this new era (the 28th Dvapara Yuga), a suitable groom lived in **Dwaraka** — **Balarama**, the elder brother of Sri Krishna.

---

### 4.4. Return to Earth: A Changed World

Raivata and Revati returned to find a completely changed planet. Their old kingdom was gone. Revati married **Balarama**, and tradition even mentions how she appeared much taller (coming from an earlier age), requiring a divine adjustment to match the physical proportions of the new era.

---

## 5. Light-Speed & Revati: The Connection

This story illustrates the concept of **time dilation** perfectly:
- To reach Brahma-loka, the travel is imagined as extremely fast.
- While the travelers experience only a **short duration**, **hundreds of years** pass on Earth.
- This aligns with the notion that **time is not absolute**—a core principle of modern relativity.

## 6. How to Read This Wisely

Whether understood as a **symbolic-philosophical** insight into the nature of existence or as a **mythic-scientific parallel** to modern physics, these stories are fascinating in how they echo ideas that modern science is now exploring formally.

Ancient Bharatiya minds were not limited by the tools of their time; they dared to conceive of a universe where time itself was flexible and the cosmos was vast beyond imagination.
