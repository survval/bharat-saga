## Introduction
The story of Karna is one of the most poignant and complex narratives in the Mahabharata. Often called the 'Suta-putra' or 'Radheya', Karna's life was defined by struggle, rejection, and an unwavering commitment to his word. Despite being born with divine origins, he faced constant social discrimination, which shaped his character and choices.

## Story / Background
Karna was the first-born of Kunti, blessed by the Sun God Surya before her marriage. Fearing social stigma, Kunti set the infant afloat in the Ganga, where he was found and raised by Adhiratha, a charioteer. Despite his humble upbringing, Karna's natural prowess as a warrior was undeniable.

His lifelong rivalry with Arjuna and his deep friendship with Duryodhana are central to the epic. Karna's loyalty to Duryodhana, who gave him status when the world rejected him, is a testament to his character, even when it placed him on the 'wrong' side of the war.

## Symbolism & Interpretations
Karna represents the **marginalized genius**. He is the symbol of merit versus birthright. His golden armor (Kavacha) and earrings (Kundala) signify his divine protection and innate goodness, which he eventually gave away in a supreme act of charity (Dana), earning him the title 'Daana-Veera Karna'.

## Life Lessons
1. **The Power of Loyalty:** Karna taught us that loyalty isn't just about being with someone when they are right, but standing by those who stood by you during your darkest times.
2. **Merit Over Birth:** He proved that skills and character are not defined by the family one is born into.
3. **The Virtue of Charity:** His willingness to give everything away, even his life-saving armor, highlights the importance of selfless giving.
4. **Resilience in Adversity:** Despite being cursed multiple times and facing constant humiliation, he never gave up on his pursuit of excellence.

## How to Apply in Daily Life
- **Recognize inner potential:** Like Karna, don't let social labels or initial setbacks define your worth. Focus on developing your skills.
- **Value deep friendships:** Stand by your true friends, but also have the courage to guide them towards the right path if they stray.
- **Practice Dana (Giving):** cultivate a habit of helping others without expecting anything in return.
- **Stay resilient:** Move forward with grace even when the odds are stacked against you.
