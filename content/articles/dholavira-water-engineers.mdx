## Introduction
In the dry salt desert of Kutch lies the ancient city of Dholavira, once part of the Indus–Saraswati Civilization (≈ 3000 BCE – 1500 BCE). 
What surprises researchers is not just its age, but its remarkable urban planning and water conservation systems — lessons relevant even today.

## Discovery & Location
- Rediscovered in 1967 by archaeologist J. P. Joshi.
- Located on Khadir Bet island, Kutch, Gujarat.
- Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2021.

## Engineering Highlights
- **Massive reservoirs** carved in stone for rainwater storage.
- **Water channels** guiding seasonal streams.
- **Step-wells and check dams** to manage scarce water.
- **Urban grid layout** similar to modern city planning.

At a time when people imagine “primitive life,” Dholavira shows an organized city with resource management smarter than many modern towns.

## Interesting Facts
- Signboards with large, unidentified script symbols were found — possibly ancient signboards.
- The city used effective drainage, showing civic awareness.
- Its decline may relate to climate drying and river shifts.

## Motivational Lessons from Dholavira
- **Scarcity inspires creativity:** Lack of water didn’t stop them.
- **Long-term planning builds civilization:** Not quick fixes.
- **Communities survive through cooperation:** Shared water, shared effort.
- **Learn from nature:** They stored what the monsoon gave.
- **Leave a mark through solutions:** Their legacy is skill, not monuments.

## How to Apply in Life
- **Use challenges as a trigger to innovate.**
- **Store your “resources”** — time, energy, money — wisely.
- **Build systems**, not just moments of effort.
- **Plan your future** like Dholavira planned its water.
