Modern physics says **light is the fastest-known traveler in the universe.** It moves at approximately **299,792 km/s**, or **186,000 miles/second**.

Surprisingly, ancient Indian texts contain a **calculation of light’s speed** that almost matches modern values — expressed poetically through a verse.

## 🌟 Vedic Reference

A verse often attributed to ancient Vedic commentators states:

> **“In half a *nimisha*, light travels 2,202 *yojanas*.”**

To understand it, we decode two ancient units:
- **1 yojana ≈ 9 miles**
- **1 day = 405,000 *nimishas*** (as per old Hindu time measurement)
- **86,400 seconds = 1 day** (modern time)

**The Calculation:**
1. 1 nimisha = 16/75 seconds
2. 1/2 nimisha = 8/75 seconds
3. In 8/75 seconds → light travels 2,202 yojanas
4. 2,202 yojanas ≈ ~19,818 miles
5. Speed ≈ **187,500 miles/second**

## 🔍 Final Comparison

| Source | Speed of Light |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ancient calculation** | ~**187,500 mi/s** |
| **Modern measurement** | **186,282 mi/s** |

➡️ **The values differ by less than 1%!**

While we cannot prove exactly *how* ancient scholars derived this number, the **concept, scale, and interpretation** are strikingly close to modern understanding.

## 🧭 What It Means

- **Intertwined Knowledge:** Ancient texts used symbolic and mathematical language where science and spirituality were not separate disciplines.
- **Timeless Curiosity:** Calculations were woven into poetry, cosmology, and philosophy, showing a deep-rooted curiosity about the universe.
- **Hidden Insights:** Older knowledge systems may still hold valuable insights that align with modern discovery.

## 🌌 Light-Speed Travel in Stories

Puranic stories often describe **time dilation** and ageless cosmic travel, where heroes return to Earth after eras have passed. These resemble **relativity concepts**, showing how ancient imagination aligned with ideas modern science now explores.

> Whether literal or symbolic, these stories remind us:
> **“We are part of something vast.”**
