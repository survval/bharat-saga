## Introduction: Why We Don’t Hear These Names in School

When we hear the word **“scientist”**, many people immediately think of:
- Newton  
- Galileo  
- Einstein  
- Edison  

But very few think of:
- **Valmiki, Vyasa, Atri, Bharadwaja, Aryabhata, Varahamihira, Brahmagupta, Bhaskaracharya, Patanjali, Panini, Charaka, Sushruta, Chanakya…**

One major reason is that modern school syllabi in India were heavily influenced by **colonial historians** who often ignored or downgraded ancient Bharatiya contributions. Many students grew up believing all science came from the West, yet traditional texts show a **very advanced intellectual culture**, where rishis were not just spiritual people, but also observers, analysts, and system-builders.

## Rishi, Maharshi, Brahmarshi – Like Degrees of Knowledge

You can roughly compare these to levels of academic study:
- **Rishi** – Like a scholar or specialist.
- **Maharshi** – Like a postgraduate-level master.
- **Brahmarshi** – Like a PhD-level seer, deeply realized and highly learned.

Their **ashrams and gurukulas** worked like modern educational institutions. Students didn’t just learn “prayers”—they learned astronomy, mathematics, medicine, ethics, and statecraft. **Yajña-kundas** (fire altars) often functioned like early labs for observing the effects of various substances on health and the environment.

## Our Blind Spot: Only Western Scientists in Textbooks

Typical textbooks highlight names like Kepler, Copernicus, and Mendel, but rarely talk about **Kanāda, Kapila, Patanjali, Panini, or Sushruta**. This creates a psychological problem, making people think Indians never contributed to science. Even if some specific claims are debated, the **volume of technical literature** from ancient India is undeniable.

## Aryabhata – The Pioneer of Astronomy & Mathematics

**Who was he?**
A great mathematician-astronomer and author of the text **Aryabhatiya**.

**What did he talk about?**
- Earth **rotating on its axis**, explaining day and night.
- Eclipses caused by **shadows**, not monsters.
- The Moon shining with **reflected light** from the Sun.
- Methods to calculate square roots, cube roots, and planetary positions.

He gave a value for **π (pi)** as **3.1416**, remarkably close to the value modern math uses.

## Varahamihira – Astronomy, Astrology & Earth Science

Varahamihira was a scholar who authored works like **Brihat Samhita** and **Pañcha Siddhāntikā**. He discussed:
- Movements of the Sun, Moon, and planets.
- Eclipses, comets, meteors, and earthquakes.
- Early ideas about **Earth as a globe** hanging without support.
- Descriptions of architecture, town planning, and agriculture.

## Brahmagupta – Advanced Mathematics & Astronomy

Brahmagupta authored **Brāhmasphuṭa Siddhānta**, where he further developed arithmetic, algebra, and geometry. Some traditions credit him with the earliest formalizations involving **zero and negative numbers**, representing a massive leap in mathematical abstraction.

---

## Bhaskara (Bhaskaracharya) – Later Master

**Bhaskara II** wrote:
- **Lilavati** (arithmetic)
- **Bijaganita** (algebra)
- Works on astronomy and calculus-like concepts.

He discussed planetary motions and advanced algebraic methods that showed extremely high-level mathematical thinking for his era.

## Beyond Names: What Matters

Three key takeaways:
1. **Methodology:** Ancient Indian thinkers were scientific in their method—observing nature, building models, and recording results.
2. **Awareness:** Our problem is not a lack of heritage, but a lack of awareness of the texts that already exist.
3. **Balance:** Pride should be balanced with honesty. Not every claim is proven, but the depth of thinking is worth celebrating.

## Conclusion

Ancient Bharatiya rishis were not just “priests.” In many cases, they were **philosophers, observers, mathematicians, astronomers, and doctors**—all in one. A wise attitude today is to respect the heritage, verify where possible, and revive what is valuable with fresh research and honesty.
