## Question: Did ancient Indians know about the speed of light?
**Draft Answer:**
Yes, there is a fascinating tradition regarding this. Vedic commentators like Sāyaṇācārya (14th century) quote a verse that translates to: *"In half a nimisha, light travels 2,202 yojanas."*

When you convert these ancient units:
- 1 day = 405,000 nimishas
- 1 yojana ≈ 9 miles

The math works out to approximately **187,500 miles/second**. For comparison, modern physics measures the speed of light at **186,282 miles/second**. That's a match within about 1%!

Beyond just the math, there are Puranic stories like the tale of King Raivata that perfectly illustrate the concept of **Time Dilation**.

I recently wrote a full breakdown of the math and the story here:

## Question: Is there any mention of aliens or life on other planets in Hindu scriptures?
**Draft Answer:**
Indian cosmology, especially in the Puranas, doesn't just mention life elsewhere—it *assumes* it. 

The concept of "many Brahmas" suggests that every star system has its own creative nature (*Prakriti*). Specifically, the texts speak of "Maheshwara planets," which are worlds inhabited by beings (*Bhūtas*).

Unlike the modern search for "aliens," the ancient view saw the universe as a series of *lokas* (realms) where life is a natural outcome of cosmic order.

I've explored the parallels between these concepts and NASA's Pioneer-10 mission here:

## Question: Why does the name of India have two versions, India and Bharat?
**Draft Answer:**
The dual identity of "India, that is Bharat" (as stated in Article 1 of the Constitution) is a bridge between our ancient heritage and our modern global presence. 

"Bharat" traces back to the legendary King Bharata and the ancient geographical concept of *Bhāratavarsha*. "India," on the other hand, evolved from the *Sindhu* river (Indus), which the Persians called *Hindu* and the Greeks called *Indos*.

It's a story of how a river's name became a nation's identity to the outside world, while the internal identity remained "Bharat."

I've written a deep dive into the history of both names here:

## Question: Who is considered the "Father of Surgery" and what were his contributions?
**Draft Answer:**
Sushruta is widely recognized as the "Father of Surgery." Living in ancient India (estimates range from 1200 BCE to 600 BCE), he authored the *Sushruta Samhita*.

His contributions were revolutionary:
1. **Rhinoplasty:** He described techniques for reconstructing the nose that are conceptually similar to modern methods.
2. **Instruments:** He detailed over 100 surgical tools made from steel.
3. **Training:** He insisted that surgeons should practice on models and inanimate objects before operating on humans.

He is part of a larger medical tradition that includes Charaka (Internal Medicine) and Patanjali (Psychology/Yoga).
