## Post 1: Speed of Light & Time Dilation
**Subreddit:** `r/IndianHistory` or `r/Space`
**Headline:** Did ancient Indian texts describe Time Dilation? The story of King Raivata and Revati.
**Body:**
Hey everyone, I was reading through some Puranic lore and came across the story of King Raivata and his daughter Revati. They visit Brahma-loka for what feels like a short time, but return to Earth only to find that thousands of years have passed.

It's a striking parallel to the modern concept of Time Dilation in Physics. I've also found an ancient calculation of the speed of light that is within 1% of the modern value (186,000 miles/s). 

If you're interested in the math and the story, I wrote a deep dive here:

Would love to hear your thoughts on these parallels!

## Post 2: Life Beyond Earth
**Subreddit:** `r/Astronomy` or `r/India`
**Headline:** From Many Brahmas to Exoplanets: The ancient Bharatiya view on "Are we alone?"
**Body:**
Modern astronomy is discovering exoplanets every day. Interestingly, the Puranas speak of "Many Brahmas" and "Maheshwara-gr̥ha" (worlds of beings), implying that life is a universal constant, not an Earthly exception.

I've put together a post comparing NASA's Pioneer-10 mission with these ancient motifs of cosmic communication.

## Post 3: India vs Bharat Discussion
**Subreddit:** `r/India` or `r/IndianHistory`
**Headline:** The fascinating history of why Article 1 says "India, that is Bharat."
**Body:**
There's been a lot of talk lately about "India" vs "Bharat." I decided to dig into the linguistic and constitutional history of these names. It's not just a recent political debate; it goes back to the Puranic *Bhāratavarsha* and the Greek *Indos*.

I've put together a comprehensive 1500+ word history of how we got both names and what they represent today.

## Post 4: The Father of Surgery
**Subreddit:** `r/ScienceBio` or `r/IndianHistory`
**Headline:** Sushruta: Did you know the Father of Surgery lived in ancient India?
**Body:**
From performing rhinoplasty (nose reconstruction) to detailing over 100 surgical instruments, Sushruta's contributions to medical science are mind-blowing. Along with Charaka's internal medicine and Patanjali's Yoga, ancient India had a highly structured medical and psychological system.
